    The Code Manifesto is a set of values, created in hopes of guiding our community towards a place that is welcoming, safe, and empowering to all. Currently, our communities are greatly lacking in diversity, and sometimes outright hostile towards the minority members that we do have. In this talk I try to illustrate that problem, and also cover WHY it matters, and finally what we can do to help fix it.

Then perhaps you need to apply some machine learning! In this talk, Christopher will cover some basic approaches to machine-learned classification as well as demonstrate a real-life application of it in PHP.

    The PHP-based CMS space is a highly competitive one. Incumbents with large communities vie with new entrants to battle it out in this contested space. And yet despite this, most of them just aren’t very good.

    If you want to have a CMS that you actually enjoy using - no matter whether you’re a developer, a designer or a content administrator - you should probably be using SilverStripe.

    Join Hamish Friedlander, CTO of SilverStripe, as he explains why what you’re currently using is awful, and how we can make your life better again.

    How do you lose 900 million dollars in 100ms? Or 8 million visits in just 4/10 of a second?

    User expectations are higher than ever when it comes to web performance, so much so that we've created an entirely new application architecture just to make it feel like our websites are faster than they actually are.

    This talk will look at how we can improve our users experience at any scale through performance optimizations at every layer of the stack, from backend to browser.

    Big-bang migrations hardly ever work and usually take significantly more effort than expected. It's also hard to convince the stakeholders there's any value in the whole operation. It's much more effective to make gradual improvements. It's also more rewarding to celebrate success after every sprint.

    Learn how to leverage Symfony to move away from an Old School PHP Spaghetti Project™ to a modern Symfony based application. Release after the first iteration and keep improving the code base, delivering value in the same time.

    It's a tough world out there. There are so many new things to learn, and the list of need-to-know's changes every day. How do you keep up? How do you move ahead? Find a mentor - but wait! Isn't this a dog-eat-dog field where admitting you don't know something is the death of your career? Maybe back in 1995, but this is the new age of open source. Collaboration and sharing of information reigns. Find a mentor to help you excel, but more importantly, find someone to mentor. Being a mentor is challenging, rewarding, and keeps you on your toes. Learn what it takes to find a mentor, be a good mentor, and what tools can help you build your mentoring relationship.
