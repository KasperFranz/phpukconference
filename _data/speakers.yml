      Adam is a PHP Agenteer (it's totally a word) at New Relic who spends most of his time swearing at C compilers and the PHP API, usually not in that order. In between said bouts of invective, Adam works on various open source projects, including PHP, and continues in his ongoing quest to find the best beer in the world. (Well, OK, it’s Westvleteren 12, but it’s a good excuse to drink more beer.)
