            description: Kubernetes, the flagship project from the Cloud Native Foundation, has become the de facto standard for running our container workloads. Unfortunately, Kubernetes is a fast moving, ever evolving, sea of complexity. From Pods to Deployments, ConfigMaps to Secrets, and PersistantVolumeClaims to StatefulSets; this workshop will get you on-course. In this workshop, David will walk you through a series of labs that will teach you everything you need to know to take your container based application and deploy it as a self-healing, redundant and resilient application on top of Kubernetes. Let's set sail.

            description: A tour of BDD best practices, applied in the PHP world. Behaviour Driven Development techniques help us to ensure that the code we're writing is solving real-world problems, and is software that matters. In this hands-on workshop we will build some simple software that fulfils a user's requirement; validate its functionality using tools such as Behat, PHPUnit and PhpSpec; and learn how our test architecture can support our application's architecture.

            description: As a kid you have ambitions for the future? "When I grow up I want to become a â€¦". Maybe you wanted to become a fireman, an astronaut, a nurse, a teacher, a police officer? As you grow up these ideas evolve and get replaced with actual ambitions, actual hopes and dreams. These might be entirely different than your childhood dreams. But how do you reach these goals? How do you accomplish these dreams? By listening to your parents, friends, or teachers? By doing it yourself? Or maybe you have given up and settled for a watered down version of the career and life you envisioned? People often attribute success to luck, and lack of success to incompetence. But what if I told you it's all about controlling the variables? Luck is something that you can control in a way. The more you figure out the context, the key players, the relationships, the values, and the rules of the ecosystem in which you want to succeed, the easier it is to gain from it. The more variables you control, the easier it is to find potential opportunities and to bank on them. Maybe you didn't get lucky, maybe you just saw it coming, and prepared yourself for it. In this keynote talk, Thijs is going to share his experiences, his hopes, his dreams, and how he applies a positive mental attitude to level up in his career, and in life in general. This is not a growth hacking talk, but a simple set of tips and tricks to succeed, even if it seems like the odds are stacked against you.

            bio: Software engineer and tech enthusiast. Co-founder of Adeva, a startup that helps global tech companies get easier access to world-class talent.
            description: Working with companies from early-stage startups to Fortune 500, I've experienced both the struggle of continuing someone else's work and the joy of it. The difference is only in their approach towards the design of their code. It's a minor effort if done on time, with a huge impact on the overall development of the software. In this presentation, we'll focus on what distinguishes a good developer from a strong one and learn how to stand out from the crowd. After this presentation, you'd understand how to incorporate the SOLID principles in your daily work and design your code for extendibility. You'd learn how to write code in a way that will make it easy to go back to a feature you developed a year ago and extend it with additional functionality in minutes, not hours.
