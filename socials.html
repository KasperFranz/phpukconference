    <h1>Socials</h1>
    <p>An important part of any conference is being able to network with other delegates and PHP UK is no exception. We will be arranging three social events - before, during and after the conference. Venues and exact times will be announced in early 2016.</p>

        <h2>Friday</h2>
        <h3>February 19</h3>
        <p>Friday night we'll be hosting our post-conference social at the nearby <a href="http://www.blueberrybar.co.uk/">Blueberry Bar</a> for some ping pong, tunes, and cocktails as we wind down the conference. We have exclusive private hire of the ping pong bar upstairs on the second floor from 7pm til midnight.</p>
        <h3>Getting in</h3>
        <p>Please bring your conference badge along as you'll need it to get in. Enter through the second door on Paul Street, marked number 4, not the main door of the bar. There will be signs and a doorman to let you know its the PHP UK party.</p>
