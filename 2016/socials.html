    <h1>Socials</h1>
    <p>An important part of any conference is being able to network with other delegates and PHP UK is no exception. We will be hosting three social events - before, during and after the conference.</p>
    <div class="col-third">
        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <h3>February 17</h3>
        <p>Wednesday night we will kick off the conference festivities with a <a href="http://phplondon.org">PHP London</a> style pubcon! We'll be meeting at Concrete (located on the lower ground floor of Pizza East restaurant) from 7pm for drinks and pizza while meeting up with other conference attendees and local PHP Londoners. At 8pm special guest <a href="/speakers/#michaelcullum">Michael Cullum</a> will be presenting his talk <a href="/schedule/#wednesday">"PHP FIG: The PSRs you've never heard of"</a>. Drinks and chat will then continue after the presentation.</p>
